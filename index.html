        <h1>Introduction to the Mountains of Central Korea</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                One of the reasons to live in Korea, as I have since 2003, is the wonderful mountains of this country.
                They are not spectacular like those found in Nepal, Europe or Alaska, but they have a wonderful variety
                of shapes and the views are excellent. I have hiked the tallest mountains of Europe including the
                Matterhorn and Mt. Blonc. I have also hiked all the the high peaks of the Adirondacks and New England
                and still find that the mountains of Korea to be challenging, a pleasure to hike and one is always
                rewarded by the excellent views. Also you are never far frm the historical sights of korea and most of
                the Buddhist temples are located in the mountains. You are reminded of this around four in the morning
                and six in the evening when the temple bells echo in the mountains. It is an amazing experience to hear
                the beautiful sound of these large bells.

        <h2>Brief word about the Geology of the Korean Mountains</h2>

                This diagram shows the joint system of the Korean Peninsula. All of the mountains (and rivers too) of
                Korea are influenced by this series of joints (zones of weakness in the rocks caused by strain due to
                crustal stress). These forces are described in the below figure and I will include that figure below
                that summarizes the geologic history of Korea. In this case it is specifically centered on the history
                of the MaEeeSan area that is highlighted by the red box in the above figure but is equally applicable to
                the general geological history of Korea. This description included below discusses one aspect of this
                history. Note that the collision of India with southern Asia influenced the geology of Korea and in fact
                was one factor that led to the uplift of the Korean plateau.

                The above figures are made by the National Park System of Korea and are found in the MaEeeSan National
                Park.

                Bear with me as the above is one explanation of what you see when climbing in the mountains of Korea.
                Now I will explain another very interesting aspect of the geological history. It is actually visible
                when you stand on the top of any of the mountains. It is the fact that most of the mountains have a
                height between 400 and 600 meters. This is a hint to their history. Another hint to their past history
                is the sinusoidal entrenched valley that many of the rivers have. Millions of years ago the land of
                Korea was very flat. The geologic term for this a peneplain. This is a very flat surface where the
                rivers freely roam without constraint and meander in “S” shaped channels across the flat land until they
                reach the ocean. Presently there are locations on the earth that show this characteristic. One example
                is the lower Mississippi River near where it enters into the Golf of Mexica. Then around seventy million
                years ago the land of present day Korea started to rise. When this happened the streams started eroding
                their channels into the ancient bedrock and the pattern they maintained was the original ancient “S”
                shaped river channel. This is exhibited very well in the lake called the Daejeon Ho, the water supply
                for the city of Daejeon. This lake shows this classic “S” shape it had when the land was flat but it has
                been exaggerated by the damming of the valley of the Kum River. There are also other influences on the
                location and alignment of the mountains including liniments and faults that the rivers follow as
                illustrated on the above figure. If you look at the map and follow the channel of the Kum River, you can
                see a long stretch of the river that is very strait. This is where the river follows a zone of weakness,
                joint, in the underlying rock. I remember canoeing this part of the river when travelling from Daejeon
                to Gunsan and wondering when we would ever reach the end of this strait channel. It was a beautiful part
                of the river with high mountains on each bank of the river, but at the time it seemed to go on forever.
                When you hike in the mountains, think of these past events and the above long past history when you look
                over the mountains in the distance. With this understanding you are able to appreciate the mountainous
                nature of the Korean Peninsula. Also realize that the collision of India with southern Asia affected the
                Korean peninsula even though it seems very far away.
