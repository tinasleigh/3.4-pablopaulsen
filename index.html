        <h1>Introduction to the Mountains of Central Korea</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                One of the reasons to live in Korea, as I have since 2003, is the wonderful mountains of this country.
                They are not spectacular like those found in Nepal, Europe or Alaska, but they have a wonderful variety
                of shapes and the views are excellent. I have hiked the tallest mountains of Europe including the
                Matterhorn and Mt. Blonc. I have also hiked all the the high peaks of the Adirondacks and New England
                and still find that the mountains of Korea to be challenging, a pleasure to hike and one is always
                rewarded by the excellent views. Also you are never far frm the historical sights of korea and most of
                the Buddhist temples are located in the mountains. You are reminded of this around four in the morning
                and six in the evening when the temple bells echo in the mountains. It is an amazing experience to hear
                the beautiful sound of these large bells.

        <h2>Brief word about the Geology of the Korean Mountains</h2>

                This diagram shows the joint system of the Korean Peninsula. All of the mountains (and rivers too) of
                Korea are influenced by this series of joints (zones of weakness in the rocks caused by strain due to
                crustal stress). These forces are described in the below figure and I will include that figure below
                that summarizes the geologic history of Korea. In this case it is specifically centered on the history
                of the MaEeeSan area that is highlighted by the red box in the above figure but is equally applicable to
                the general geological history of Korea. This description included below discusses one aspect of this
                history. Note that the collision of India with southern Asia influenced the geology of Korea and in fact
                was one factor that led to the uplift of the Korean plateau.

            <p>
                The above figures are made by the National Park System of Korea and are found in the MaEeeSan National
                Park.
                <br>
                Bear with me as the above is one explanation of what you see when climbing in the mountains of Korea.
                Now I will explain another very interesting aspect of the geological history. It is actually visible
                when you stand on the top of any of the mountains. It is the fact that most of the mountains have a
                height between 400 and 600 meters. This is a hint to their history. Another hint to their past history
                is the sinusoidal entrenched valley that many of the rivers have. Millions of years ago the land of
                Korea was very flat. The geologic term for this a peneplain. This is a very flat surface where the
                rivers freely roam without constraint and meander in “S” shaped channels across the flat land until they
                reach the ocean. Presently there are locations on the earth that show this characteristic. One example
                is the lower Mississippi River near where it enters into the Golf of Mexica. Then around seventy million
                years ago the land of present day Korea started to rise. When this happened the streams started eroding
                their channels into the ancient bedrock and the pattern they maintained was the original ancient “S”
                shaped river channel. This is exhibited very well in the lake called the Daejeon Ho, the water supply
                for the city of Daejeon. This lake shows this classic “S” shape it had when the land was flat but it has
                been exaggerated by the damming of the valley of the Kum River. There are also other influences on the
                location and alignment of the mountains including liniments and faults that the rivers follow as
                illustrated on the above figure. If you look at the map and follow the channel of the Kum River, you can
                see a long stretch of the river that is very strait. This is where the river follows a zone of weakness,
                joint, in the underlying rock. I remember canoeing this part of the river when travelling from Daejeon
                to Gunsan and wondering when we would ever reach the end of this strait channel. It was a beautiful part
                of the river with high mountains on each bank of the river, but at the time it seemed to go on forever.
                When you hike in the mountains, think of these past events and the above long past history when you look
                over the mountains in the distance. With this understanding you are able to appreciate the mountainous
                nature of the Korean Peninsula. Also realize that the collision of India with southern Asia affected the
                Korean peninsula even though it seems very far away.

            <h1>Word about the hiking trails of South Korea</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I view Korea as a great hiking country. Almost everyone in Korea has hiked in the mountains at one time
                in their life. The middle schools and high schools often have hikes into the mountains in the spring.
                Also companies have the tradition of employees going to the mountains as part of their celebration of an
                accomplishment or as a way of bonding with fellow employees. One reason for this is that the mountains
                are always nearby. Another reason is that the love of nature is very much a part of the people’s
                philosophy. Seldom will you be up in the mountains without seeing hikers on the trail and often they are
                in groups. That is true in the hot days of summer and the cold days of winter. Many of the trails have
                been built over thousands of years. They do not have the trail markers on the trees like many countries
                mark their trails but usually at the beginning of the trail there is a large sign with a map indicating
                all the mountain trails specific to that mountain range. This is well worth photographing with your hand
                phone or camera in case for some reason you become lost during your hike. Also if you have a hand phone,
                turn on the tracking app. This is a handy way to follow your location and anticipate the trail
                intersections ahead. Most of the trails are so obvious that they do not need to be referred to but still
                they are there is needed. Also the trail itself exhibits the signs of having been created over a long
                period of time. Remember that thousands of years before America was discovered by Columbus, people were
                hiking in the mountains of Korea. There are large rocks that have been obviously moved to make steps and
                even in places there are steps that have been carved into the rock faces (this includes names carver
                centuries ago using Chinese letters). When you see this, you feel that the people of Korea have become
                part of the land.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <div class="img_container left small"><img src="images/KuBongSan_map.jpg"></div>
            <p>
                Where the trails intersect there is almost always a sign directing you to the correct path to take. This
                is indicated by the name of the next peak including or the direction down to the beginning of the trail
                including the distance to the listed feature. If you become lost do not panic. Seldom are you many miles
                from a road. Also there are many public bus routes so look for a bus stop. Also do not hesitate to ask
                other hikers directions. I am always amazed at how willing Koreans are to help when it is needed and
                also their skill in a foreign language including English. Another item you will see along the trail is a
                post with the telephone number of 119 listed and the height and location of the post. These sometimes
                have a first aid kit included. They are to be used when someone is injured or some other assistance is
                needed. I have been on the trail when this emergency system was used because a hiker became disabled. In
                this case a helicopter came to evacuate the injured person. I was really impressed by the efficiency of
                this operation.
                <br>
                Always in Korea forest fires are a great danger. Most of the rainfall occurs during the summer monsoon
                that starts in June and ends in August. The rest of the year there is very little rain and the forests
                become very parched and prone to fire. This is the reason that there are signs along the trail warning
                about fires. You are not allowed to build fires in the forests and smoking is not allowed on the
                mountains. I have seen the result of fires and it is devastating. Whole areas have been burnt over with
                no trees surviving. I have also seen forest fires in the distance and they are very difficult to fight
                as most of the mountains are not approachable by vehicles and I have never seen a fire fought by the use
                of those special airplanes one sees used in the California fires (they might have these but I have never
                seen them). So it is best to never have an open flame while hiking it the Korean forests.

            <h1>Items Seen along the Trail for safety and emergencies(find image of korean helipad)</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>There are many items that you will observe along the trails that have and do not have counterparts in the
                West. One interesting item is the post with numbers that are used to give your location in longitude and
                latitude to a rescue helicopter of rescue team. The number to remember is 119. This is the equivalent to
                911 in the US and like in the US, it is not to be used except during a Bonafede emergency. I have seen
                its use in the mountains and observed a helicopter come and rescue a man who lost the feeling in his
                legs during a hike on DoGyuSan. I was impressed with the quick response of the helicopter to the rescue
                scene. Also I observed the response to a forest fire while on a bike hike along one of the Daejeon bike
                paths. Within ten minutes the fire trucks had arrived and were soon pumping water on the fire and within
                five minutes more it was extinguished. In this case a road was near where the fire had started.

                This is an example of two of these location signs. The one on the left provides the emergency number to
                call and also the coordinates of the location 9519 9987 and the words Da Ba with the Korean language
                equivalent. The one on the right gives the position number in Korean for the location and has a beacon
                light to aid in a rescue. In this case you might need help from a Korean in giving the location to the
                emergency responders. But this type of older sign is rare and most of the signs have the information
                also written in English.

            <p>
                Another item you will observe on the trails is the first aid box next to the trail. These are not as
                common as the above signs but they are located along the trail in specified locations. Here is an
                example of one I recently observed. Note that this one has a red light that can be turned on at night.
                Unfortunately all instructions in Korean language but I am sure that if you wait a while a hiker will
                come along and aid you in opening it. Otherwise you can try to force it open if you are in a truly
                dangerous situation.

                The other situation that happens is you become lost. I have had this happen a few times and my advice it
                to stay on the trail and wait for a fellow hiker to come along to assist you. The common thing I have
                had happen is I came to a trail junction and do not know or remember which trail to take. The problem is
                increased as you may not know what the sign says. In the past when hiking and I know that I will be
                coming back to the junction, I and put down a stick that indicated which way to go on the return part of
                the hike and photographed it for future reference.

                Many of the highest mountains of Korea have shelters when you can stay. Most of these require you to
                sign up for lodging and they are extremely inexpensive and usually have food available along with hot
                water. The taller mountains that come to mind are SaRakSan and CheRiSan. These are not fancy and do not
                rate for many stars but they are utilitarian and well stocked, including a bathroom, to help you have a
                good nights sleep. At the same time realize that Koreans are very early raisers as they love to observe
                the sunrise. They often arise at four in the morning so they are on the top of the mountain as the time
                to watch the sun rise over the East Sea when staying at the one on SaRakSan on the east coast. Another
                place to stay is the Buddhist Mountain temples. Again you must make arrangements before and also the
                Buddhists are all up at the crack of dawn, usually before four in the morning. Also they expect you to
                be in bed by ten and do not tolerate noise. Alsoo the Buddhist temples are a more expensive place to
                stay but the lodging provided are very nice with a single room. Also the sexes are usually segregated.
